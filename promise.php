				<h2>Neurotech<sup>EU</sup>: Designed by students, for students</h2>
					To create our action plan for the outlined vision, we asked students what they need to succeed during their education and to start their professional life (www.bit.ly/NeurotechQ4S).  More than 3,500+ students responded to the survey.  84% of the responders are bachelor and master students, studying engineering (16%), natural sciences (15%), social sciences (11%), health sciences (10%), education (9%), business, administration and law (8%), and art & humanities (7%).  Remaining students major in multiple fields, supporting the observation and experience of the Neurotech<sup>EU</sup> partners in our own students across campuses, i.e. studies in the intersection of Brain and Technology attract interest from students of all backgrounds in general universities. Among the responders:
					<ul><li><b>Half of the students would like to have multiple opportunities for mobility across the different stages of their studies</b>
					<br><i>Therefore, we designed mobility periods for bachelor, master and doctoral students</i></li>
					<li><b>~85% want to do more than taking classes during the mobility window</b>
					<br><i>We designed research, internship and apprenticeship programs. We have recruited 250+ associate partners to provide options for our students</i></li>
					<li><b>40% prefer a mobility window of &lt;9 months, others longer including up to 3 years (9%)</b>
					<br><i>We planned for flexible mobility period across the three different stages of their studies and will form a graduate school to support longer mobility periods that will promote inter-campus and inter-sectoral cooperation in teaching and research</i></li>
					<li><b>~87% of the students are interested in virtual exchange and mobility</b>
					<br><i>We partnered with technology providers to offer online platforms to study, learn and create together, helping us to meet our 50% mobility goal and reduce the cost of mobility</i></li>
					<li><b>~84% of the students are concerned about the financial costs associated with mobility</b>
					<br><i>We designed the mobility programs to create synergy with local, national and other EU funding programs</i></li></ul>
